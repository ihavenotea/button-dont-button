## Button Don't Button

A common user interface challenge occurs when you have a UI element
that is clearly necessary to the page layout, but whose funtionality
is poorly (if at all) defined. When faced with this challenge a simple
mechanism is needed to ensure that the button does the right thing,
which is to not button.

This library provides a simple jQuery pluggin that allows you to
easily convert any UI element into a button that won't button.
